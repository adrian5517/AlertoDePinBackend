# Deprecated: this repository now uses a single root `.env` file.
# Please create or edit the repository root `.env` instead of this file.
# Example: move variables here into `../.env` and then delete this file.

# NOTE: For security, the root `.env` is ignored by git (see .gitignore).

# This file is kept for compatibility but is intentionally empty.
